### 3rd party libraries (included)
- [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
- [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw)

## Setup Instructions

To set up the project:

1. Navigate to the `scripts` folder.
2. Run `Setup.bat`. This will build the project using Premake.
3. Once the setup is complete, you should see a `ZeroEngineApp.sln` file in the project directory.
4. Open `ZeroEngineApp.sln` in Visual Studio, and you're ready to go!
